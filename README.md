# Movie Catcher

A simple website of movies.

Check how it looks like here: [movie-catcher.netlify.app](https://movie-catcher.netlify.app/)

I'm using a free API-key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and image for 404 from [Muhammad Ali](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/muhammad-ali)

### Usage
1. Get the project to your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/t-pyrope/movie-catcher.git
cd movie-catcher
npm install
```
2. Get the API-key: you need to register on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to get it.
3. Create `.env` file inside the root folder and put your key inside:
```
REACT_APP_MOVIE_API_KEY=*************************
```

### Running the website in the development mode

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
